# Timbobs Server
This is a step by step guide to modded Minecraft. We will be using prism as our launcher since it includes all other modpack systems as well as making it stupid easy to add your own mods, resource packs, or shaders without needing Tim to help.

The modpack comes with the mods, resource packs, shaders, and even the server pre-added

If you experience any issues, server lag, or crashes. Inform Timbob. The server and the modpack are new to us as much as it is new to you, and not everything has been tested or experienced. This server was founded on a whim and therefore changes may need to be made to fix things.

## Getting Started
You need java 17 and prism, you can find both below:

[Get Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?arch=x64&package=jdk&version=17http:// "Get Java 17")

[Get Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/download/ "Get Prism")

[Get the modpack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19AJ7Rz8mjl2VkOGs8B3saYx-bkRqe5eE/view?usp=sharing)

[Resource Pack Load order](##Resource-Pack-Load-Order)

## Setting up Prism
When first starting prism you are going to be guided through a startup wizard, here are my recomendations

### Select the correct java
Make sure under version you select the one that says 17. Your system may have multiple versions like mine does.
You will also notice at the bottom, I have set maximum memory allocation to 12000 MiB

The minimum this value can be is 10000 Mib which means you system needs at least **12gb of ram **for ideal play.
I **cannot** fix this. This is the nature of 611 mods.

### Interface
If you are a dark mode stan like most users seem to be these days I suggest, flat white icons and dark widgets
if you are a bright mode paragon I suggest flat black icons and light widgets

The choice of you chosen cat soilder is not mandated but the republic does wish to remind you that there is *only* one **correct** choice.

## Adding the modpack
Here are the steps for adding the modpack to Prism

### Add a new instance
In the top left click, add instance

### Import
Make sure on the left hand side, import is selected instead of custom

After that just select the TimbobsServer.zip you downloaded earlier and it will import all of the default files.

## Speacial Note
Upon clicking play you will be walked through adding your microsoft account. I assume you do not need a guide on this, if you do let me know and I will update this section. I have the images but I trust you can figure this part out.

## Resource Pack Load Order
This is somewhat important. Due to the nature of some of the resource packs and what they change there is in fact an ideal load order.
By default I have only enabled small UI modifications on your first run. If however you would like to use all of them. This is the correct order that will result in nothing being broken and or janky.
